Sublime-Vintage-cheatsheet
==========================

A cheatsheet for using Vintage mode in Sublime Text 2 (and presumably ST3).

Sublime Text has most of the basic Vim keyboard shortcuts that I use, but a few things (e.g., :s/old/new/c) are not present. This sheet captures the things I use regularly and can be readily expanded/revised as necessary.  The .pdf version is sized for a centered desktop image on a 1280x800 screen, but could easily be resized.

This cheatsheet is released under a Creative Common CC0 license so that anybody can do whatever they want with it!
